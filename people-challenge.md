# 🚀 People Team Live Challenge – Galactic Calculation Agent 

## 👩‍🚀 Introduction

You have been appointed as **CloudWalk's Stellar Fleet Support Officer**!

During space missions, you need to make quick decisions based on curious data from the universe. Fortunately, you have access to an AI copilot — like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, or any other tool you prefer.

---

## 🎯 Your challenge (total time: up to 15 min)

Create a **mini assistant** that answers space questions using AI.

### You can choose one approach:
- Create a **structured project** in ChatGPT Playground, Custom GPTs, or Claude Projects (NOT just a simple chat conversation - must use system prompts, examples, and testing)
- Or simulate a basic agent with AI help, like a Python function with responses

> ⚠️ **Important:** We want to see a **designed solution**, not just asking questions to ChatGPT. Show us your prompt engineering and system design skills!

---

## 🧪 What it should answer

The agent should answer questions like:
- "How many km is a light-year?"
- "If I travel at 100,000 km/h, how long does it take to cross the galaxy?"
- "How much energy do I spend teleporting a team to Mars?"
- "What's the reward for completing 1 million km on a mission?"

💡 **Tip:** You can invent the data, keep it fun, or use real curiosities.

---

## ✅ What we expect

- That you **explore AI** creatively
- That you think in a **structured way**: good commands or clear logic
- That you **play with the theme** and show curiosity


---

## 🛑 Quick rules

- **No need to program!** You can use just text and AI in a LLM project
- The important thing is to **think about how to use AI** to solve problems
- **Total time:** up to 15 minutes, with creative freedom

---

## 📊 How it will be evaluated:
- **Creativity in approach** (40%)
- **Prompt/logic structure** (30%) 
- **Quality of responses** (30%)

---

## ⚡ Bonus Challenges (if time allows):

- Add unique personality to the agent

**Good luck, Stellar Officer! 🚀**
